## How It Works Now

When you say **"process my meeting notes"**, here's what happens:

### Step 1: Find Meetings
I run Python code to find unread Gemini meeting notes:
```python
from gutAutomate import find_gemini_meeting_notes
emails = find_gemini_meeting_notes()
```

### Step 2: Ask for Your Approval
I use `AskUserQuestion` to show you the meetings and ask which to process.

### Step 3: Run gutAutomate.py in Claude Mode
I execute:
```bash
python3 process_with_mcp.py "<your_selection>" "y"
```

This wrapper:
1. Runs gutAutomate.py with your selection
2. Marks emails as read
3. Copies docs to shared drive
4. Parses action items with full context
5. Outputs JSON with prepared tasks

### Step 4: Parse JSON Output
I extract the JSON containing:
- All prepared tasks (with full context)
- Notification task details
- List ID and destination info

### Step 5: Ask for Final Confirmation
I show you a preview of the tasks and ask:
"Create these X tasks in ClickUp?"

### Step 6: Create Tasks via MCP
I call:
```
mcp__clickup__clickup_create_bulk_tasks(
  list_id=...,
  tasks=[...prepared tasks with full context...]
)
```

### Step 7: Create Notification
I call:
```
mcp__clickup__clickup_create_task(
  list_id="901112235176",  # Automation Summaries
  name="ðŸ¤– gutAutomate processed meeting...",
  assignees=["drew@gutfeeling.agency"],
  ...
)
```

## Benefits

âœ… **You control approval** - Asked at every step via AskUserQuestion
âœ… **All context preserved** - Details section included in task descriptions
âœ… **MCP tools used** - Direct ClickUp integration
âœ… **Fully automated** - No manual copy/paste needed
âœ… **Reliable** - Script handles all the parsing and preparation

## Usage

Just tell me: **"Process my meeting notes"**

That's it! I'll handle the rest and ask for your approval at each step.
