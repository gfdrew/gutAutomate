# gutAutomate MCP Integration Summary

## What Changed

### Before (Manual MCP Calls)
- Script would prepare task data but couldn't create tasks
- Required manual intervention via Claude Code
- Lost all context from meeting notes
- Had to manually copy task details

### After (Integrated MCP Support)
- **Claude Mode** automatically creates tasks via MCP
- **ALL context preserved** in task descriptions
- **Auto-approves meetings** (no prompts/input() blocking)
- **Auto-confirms task creation** (fully automated)
- **Rich task descriptions** with context from Details section

## Key Improvements

### 1. No More Context Loss âœ…
Each task now includes:
```markdown
**Action Item:** [task text]

**Context from Meeting:**
[Relevant paragraphs from Details section that relate to this task]

**Source:** [Meeting Title]
```

### 2. Auto-Detection & Tagging âœ…
- Automatically detects meeting type (bevmo, vfx, total wine, etc.)
- Applies appropriate tags to all tasks
- Routes to correct ClickUp list based on meeting name

### 3. Full Automation in Claude Mode âœ…
When you run `python3 gutAutomate.py claude`:
- âœ… Auto-approves ALL unread meetings
- âœ… Auto-confirms task creation
- âœ… Marks emails as read
- âœ… Copies docs to shared drive
- âœ… Filters checkboxes and special characters
- âœ… Extracts context from Details section
- âœ… Parses due dates from natural language
- âœ… Resolves assignees (drew, art, matt, kato, paula)
- âœ… Creates tasks directly via MCP tools
- âœ… Sends notification to Drew in Automation Summaries

## How It Works

### Function Changes

#### 1. `prompt_for_meeting_approval(emails, claude_mode=False)`
- **Before:** Always prompted user with `input()`
- **After:** Auto-approves all if `claude_mode=True`

#### 2. `preview_clickup_tasks(action_items, meeting_title, destination, claude_mode=False)`
- **Before:** Always prompted for confirmation with `input()`
- **After:** Auto-confirms if `claude_mode=True`

#### 3. `create_clickup_tasks_via_mcp(action_items, destination, meeting_title, claude_mode=False)`
- **New function** that prepares tasks with full context
- Auto-detects meeting tags (bevmo, vfx, total-wine)
- Builds rich markdown descriptions with context
- In `claude_mode`, writes JSON to temp file for MCP

### Context Extraction

The script now extracts context for each task:

```python
# Find relevant context from Details section
context = find_relevant_context(task_text, details_section, assignee)
```

This searches the Details section for:
- Keywords from the task text
- Mentions of the assignee's name
- Related topic sentences

Result: Tasks have **meaningful context** instead of just the action item text!

## Example Task Output

### Before (No Context)
```
Name: Provide realistic budget
Description: [empty or minimal]
```

### After (With Context)
```
Name: Provide realistic budget for shoot

Description:
**Action Item:** Provide realistic budget for shoot

**Context from Meeting:**
Discussion about budget requirements for the upcoming shoot. Team needs
accurate cost estimates to move forward with planning. The client has
requested a detailed breakdown including equipment, crew, and post-production
costs. Matt Rose will coordinate with accounting to ensure all line items
are covered.

## Usage

### Run in Claude Mode (Fully Automated)
```bash
cd /Users/drew/Desktop/into_the_future
python3 gutAutomate.py claude
```

**What happens:**
1. Finds ALL unread meeting notes
2. Auto-approves all meetings
3. Marks emails as read
4. Copies docs to shared drive
5. Extracts ALL context from Details sections
6. Creates tasks with full context via MCP
7. Sends notification to Drew

### Run in Interactive Mode (Manual Control)
```bash
python3 gutAutomate.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Shows list of unread meetings
2. Prompts you to select which ones to process
3. Shows preview with full context
4. Asks for confirmation before creating
5. Creates via REST API (requires CLICKUP_API_TOKEN)

### Run Non-Interactive (Like taskUpSolo.py)
```bash
python3 taskUpSolo.py claude
```

Same as gutAutomate.py claude mode but separate file.

## Technical Details

### MCP Integration Points

1. **Task Creation:** `mcp__clickup__clickup_create_bulk_tasks`
   - Receives prepared tasks with full context
   - Creates all tasks in single batch
   - Preserves all assignees, tags, priorities, due dates

2. **Notification Creation:** `mcp__clickup__clickup_create_task`
   - Creates summary in Automation Summaries list
   - Assigns to drew@gutfeeling.agency
   - Includes count and meeting details

### Data Flow

```
Gmail API (unread emails)
    â†“
Google Docs API (fetch content + copy to shared drive)
    â†“
parse_action_items() [extract tasks]
    â†“
extract_details_section() [get context]
    â†“
find_relevant_context() [match context to tasks]
    â†“
create_clickup_tasks_via_mcp() [build rich descriptions]
    â†“
MCP Tools (create in ClickUp)
    â†“
send_drew_notification() [summary task]
```
